# <Portfolio Gerard  Del Vecchio>

## Description



I wanted to create a portfolio page with my potential work

with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications
WHEN I am presented with my first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Credits

This is  my second challenge: my Portfolio, which will be implemented progressively by adding the latest group project, and challenges but also with the new programming languages that I will probably learn.
I want to thanks my team members for the first project.
I want to thanks all the teaching team in that BOOTCAMP challenge!!!
I'll continue to learn with my classes and by mixing the differents coding sources.
